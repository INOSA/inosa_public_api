        # INOSA Public API Documentation

        Public API is a subset of internal INOSA API endpoints that are publicly available. The documentation page you are currently browsing shows these exposed endpoints and tells how to integrate third-party applications with INOSA.

        ## Authorization
        Public API is a *REST API* that uses OAuth2 as an authorization protocol. The currently used method of authorization is the **client credentials** flow described in OAuth2 [RFC page](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).
        This documentation provides try-it functionality. In order to try an endpoint click on the Authorize button, provide generated credentials, select scopes and then send a request to generate the token.
        Token will be stored between the request so there is no need to generate it for the every single call.
        
        ## Getting started
        To get started you need to have client credentials generated by the INOSA application Administrator. Credentials consist of pair `client_id` and `client_secret` that are confidential and **MUST** be kept secret. As soon as you have them you can call the token endpoint to get Access Token. 

        ## Receiving access token
        In the token request, [client_idenfier] and [client_secret] is the pair of keys generated by the INOSA application administrator.
        ```
        POST /token
        Content-type: application-json
        {
        	"client_id": [client_idenfier],
        	"client_secret": [client_secret],
        	"grant_type": "client_credentials"
        }
        ```
        
        ## Access tokens
        Access token in Public API has a JWT format and will grant you access to the endpoints. Simply, put it in the Authorization header of the request `e.g. Authorization: Bearer [generated_token]`.
        
        Each access token lasts for 1 hour and needs to be regenerated after that time, it also carries information about granted scopes - in the current version `public-api` scope is the only supported and allow to request all available endpoints.

        The `Endpoint` means one of the available ways of communicating with the Public API. Each endpoint has a specific structure, that consists of the HTTP method like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, request URI, request params also known as query parameters, request body needed for endpoints that require JSON payload, and request headers.

        ## Identifiers
        In the documentation we are going to use word `UUID` that is a [version 4 universal identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)) used within INOSA application. 
        
        In the documentation, all parameters named with suffix **id** like **departmentId**, **permissionsGroupsId**, **roleId** mean respectively INOSA application department UUID, permissions groups UUID, role UUID. This rule applies for all the INOSA related items named with such pattern. 
        It may occur that the parameter name does not have **id** suffix but the particular endpoint documentation says explicitly that in fact it's required to send UUID's.
        Identifiers can be fetched by using Public API exposed endpoints.

        ## Examples
        Example usage of the endpoint with request parameter.
        ```
        GET /api/users/{id}/reading-status
        Authorization: Bearer [token]
        ```
        in the example `{id}` is a UUID of the INOSA application user. 
        [token] is just a placeholder for the token received from the **/token** endpoint.

        When it comes to requests that require a request body, Public API uses JSON for exchanging data. Example usage of endpoint responsible for connecting roles to particular user would look like that:
        ```
        PUT /api/users/{userId}/roles
        Authorization: Bearer [token]
        Content-type: application-json
        {
        	"e9d56d50-8e9e-49d3-bf25-d5b3a464b84b",
        	"b60de267-f657-43eb-b0a1-a2929e262864"
        }
        ```
        Payload data consists of two INOSA application *roles* UUID and *userId* is a request parameters that is INOSA application user UUID identifier.
